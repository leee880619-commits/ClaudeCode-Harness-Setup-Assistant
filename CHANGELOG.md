## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

Initial public release (soft launch).

### Added
- Plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) with custom component paths for `.claude/agents/`, `commands/`, and `.claude/hooks/hooks.json`.
- Self-hosted single-plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- Orchestrator slash command `/harness-architect:harness-setup` (entry point at `commands/harness-setup.md`).
- 8 Phase workers under `.claude/agents/`:
  `phase-setup`, `phase-workflow`, `phase-pipeline`, `phase-team`, `phase-skills`, `phase-hooks`, `phase-validate`, `red-team-advisor`.
- 11 playbooks under `playbooks/` (Agent-Playbook separation — HOW files, not exposed as Skills to the main session).
- 4 always-apply rules under `.claude/rules/`:
  `orchestrator-protocol`, `question-discipline`, `output-quality`, `meta-leakage-guard`.
- 2 plugin hooks under `.claude/hooks/`:
  `ownership-guard.sh` (PreToolUse Write/Edit — scope guard) and `syntax-check.sh` (PostToolUse Write/Edit — JSON/YAML validation).
- 14-file knowledge base under `knowledge/` (commentary derived from Claude Code documentation).
- 3 validation checklists under `checklists/`:
  `validation-checklist`, `security-audit`, `meta-leakage-keywords`.
- `strict-coding-6step` workflow preset under `.claude/templates/workflows/` for complex coding projects (8 agents + 8 playbooks).
- Documentation: `README.md` (Korean), `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0).

### Known limitations
- English README (`README_EN.md`) and `examples/` scenarios are incomplete in this release — see Unreleased.
- Submission to the official Anthropic plugin marketplace has not been completed; installation currently relies on GitHub-hosted marketplace path.
